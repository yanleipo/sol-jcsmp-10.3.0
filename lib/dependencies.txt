JCSMP API Dependencies

To build/run JCSMP API based applications, the following jar files listed in lib directory 
are needed:
   commons-lang-2.6.jar
   commons-logging-1.1.3.jar
   sol-jcsmp-<version>.jar

The jar files in lib/optional directory are packaged for convenience purposes, 
they include files used for logging and debugging. They also include the legacy
sol-common-<version>.jar of which contents have now been moved to sol-jcsmp-<version>.jar
and is no longer needed.

NOTICE: Including log4j-1.2.9.jar without a log4j.properties file on the classpath
may impact program performance by turning the log level to DEBUG.
