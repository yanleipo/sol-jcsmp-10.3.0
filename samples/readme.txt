                   Messaging API for Java Sample Applications

INTRODUCTION

   These  samples  provide  a  basic introduction to using the Solace Messaging API for
   Java (JCSMP) in messaging applications. Common uses, such as sending  a  mes-
   sage,  receiving  a message, asynchronous messaging, and subscription manage-
   ment, are described in detail in these samples.

   Before working with these samples, ensure that you have read  and  understood
   the basic concepts found in the Solace Messaging APIs Developer Guide.

   ning the JCSMP samples:

     o Apache Ant version 1.6.5

HOW TO BUILD THE SAMPLES

   To  build  the  samples,  go to the samples directory and invoke "ant build".
   Note that this command performs clean before starting the build process.


CONFIGURING THE SOLACE APPLIANCE

   Some samples rely on the presence of a sample durable Queue  and  Topic  End-
   point.   In  addition  to  configuring  the appliance to authenticate the sample
   applications successfully, you must do the following:

     o Create a queue named my_sample_queue

     o Create a durable Topic Endpoint named
       my_sample_topicendpoint

     o Ensure the message-vpn  you  use  is  marked  as  the
       appliance's management message-vpn

     o For  SolCache samples, ensure a cache is setup on the
       Solace appliance


HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLES

   A startup script is provided to set up the Java CLASSPATH and start any  pro-
   vided  sample.  To run the startup script, go to the bin directory, and enter
   the following command:

   On LINUX:
     run.sh introsamples.CLASSNAME -h applianceip[:port] \
     -u username[@vpn] [-w password]

   On Windows:
     run.bat introsamples.CLASSNAME -h applianceip[:port] \
     -u username[@vpn] [-w password]

   If you are running the samples on UNIX/LINUX, ensure that execute permissions
   are enabled for run.sh.
